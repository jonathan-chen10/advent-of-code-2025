# Advent of Code 2025 — Jonathan Chen

Solutions to Advent of Code 2025, in Python 3.14.

My only goal is to finish the Advent of Code, i.e. do one problem every day. With 12 days it should be easier.

| Day                      | Part 1                                       | Part 2                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [Day 1](./day_1/soln.py) | Addition mod 100                             | Per-step Integer division                |
| [Day 2](./day_2/soln.py) | Find first and last repeating nums per range | Repeat part 1 for all sizes, remove dups |
| [Day 3](./day_3/soln.py) | Greedily pick each digit                     | Same as part 1                           |
| [Day 4](./day_4/soln.py) | Iterate through all locations/neighbors      | Iteratively remove until fixed point     |
| [Day 5](./day_5/soln.py) | Linear scan of ranges                        | Merge intervals and add widths           |
| [Day 6](./day_6/soln.py) | Parse rows and operate column-wise           | Parse column-wise right to left          |
| [Day 7](./day_7/soln.py) | Simulate splitting in one pass               | Simulate timelines per branch (DP-like)  |
| [Day 8](./day_8/soln.py) | Kruskal's union-find implementation          | Return trace when spanning tree complete |
| [Day 9](./day_9/soln.py) | Calculate area of all n^2 pairs naively      | Check rectangle against edges + ray cast |
